# Learning Experiment

# Hypothesis
*If I take notes while completing my learning activities, then I will recall more information compared to not taking notes, because it requires me to actively listen and process information, reinforcing key concepts through engagement.*

I wanted to test this method of learning because typically I will not take any notes when completing my learning activities each week and I believe I quickly forget some of the content I'm watching. I researched some methods of study and unsurprisingly note taking was one of the top methods, so I believe this is a suitable method to test with a reasonable chance of improving my retention of information.

# Test

1. Complete 30 minutes of a relevant LinkedIn Learning course without taking notes.
2. Enter the transcript from the course into DeepSeek and prompt it to generate 20 questions and answers based on the content.
3. Answer the questions and determine a mark out of 20.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 but with a different LinkedIn Learning course and take notes this time.

By comparing the marks I get using each method, I will be able to determine to a moderate degree if this method of learning is effective for me. It should be noted that this only includes one test, and more data would be required to gain a more definite answer. The test scores are a quantitative measure of effectiveness, so I will also be writing a short response about how I felt each method worked that can also be used in the evaluation. Another point of interest is that because I am using two different courses for each part of the test this may effect the final result if the questions and content are more difficult in one course compared to the other.

Prompt used in DeepSeek:
Create 20 questions (10 multi-choice and 10 short answer) and answers based on the content in the following transcript from a LinkedIn Learning course: *Transcript*

# Results

Without taking notes - 16/20 (80%) questions answered correctly
With taking notes    - 19/20 (95%) questions answered correctly

From these results it can be seen I achieved a 15% better mark when I took notes while learning compared to when I wasn't.


## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 2 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

From this week's learning experiment I found that while I did perform marginally better on the quiz when I took notes while learning, I also noticed that I was able to get through noticably less content while taking notes. This was because I would pause the video in order to process what I had just learned and write it down in my own words. While I believe this did help consolidate the concepts I was learning, it certainly took more time. While taking notes is not completely necessary as I am able to revisit the original content at anytime, I believe it still helped me better understand the content and adds the benefit I can go back and relearn the content from my own words which I think I'll understand better. In my opinion, I think this makes the extra time taken worth it, and in the coming weeks I'll continue to take notes during my learning activities.
