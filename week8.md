### Learning Experiment

### Hypothesis
*If I take notes while completing my learning activities, I will recall more information compared to not taking notes, as it requires me to actively listen and process the material, reinforcing key concepts through engagement.*

I wanted to test this learning method because, typically, I do not take any notes when completing my weekly learning activities, and I quickly forget some of the content I watch. After researching study techniques, I found, unsurprisingly, that note-taking was one of the most effective methods. Therefore, I believe this is a suitable approach to test, with a reasonable chance of improving my information retention.

### Test

Phase 1: No Notes
1. Complete 30 minutes of a relevant LinkedIn Learning course without taking any notes.
2. Extract the course transcript and input it into DeepSeek.
3. Prompt DeepSeek to generate 10 multiple-choice questions, 10 short-answer questions and the answers associated with them based on the content.
4. Answer all 20 questions without reference materials and record mark out of 20.

Phase 2: With Notes
1. Complete 30 minutes of a different LinkedIn Learning course while taking notes.
2. Follow steps 2-5 from phase 1 using the new content.

By comparing the marks I achieve using each method, I will be able to determine to a moderate degree whether this learning method is effective for me. However, it should be noted that this test includes only one trial. More data would be required to obtain a definitive answer. Another consideration is that because I am using two different courses for each part of the test, this may affect the final results if either the content or the generated questions are more challenging in one course compared to the other.

Prompt used in DeepSeek:
Create 20 questions (10 multi-choice and 10 short answer) and answers based on the content in the following transcript from a LinkedIn Learning course: *Transcript*

### Results

- Phase 1: No Notes   - 16/20 (80%) questions answered correctly
- Phase 2: With Notes - 19/20 (95%) questions answered correctly

From these results, it can be seen that I achieved a 15% higher score when taking notes during learning compared to when I did not.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 2 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

Conditional Tags are WordPress functions that execute code only when specific conditions are met. Descriptions of these tags can be found in the [WordPress Conditional Tags Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags). For example, the `is_front_page() ` tag checks whether the current page is the site's front page. This could be used to display a hero image only on the website's homepage.

The `get_template_part()` WordPress function is a template tag that allows developers to reuse template code across mutliple theme files. This means that instead of repeating the same HTML/PHP code on multiple pages, developers can create a separate template file (e.g. `content.php`) and reuse it throughout their theme. This follows the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principal by removing duplicate code.

PHP powers approximately 80% of websites using server-side technology. The latest release is PHP 8.4.5, which launched on 13th March 2025. The `php.ini` file is a configuration file containing your web server's PHP settings. When php.ini is inaccessible, the `.htaccess` file can adjust PHP settings on Apache servers.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

From this week's learning experiment, I found that while I did perform marginally better on the quiz when taking notes while learning, I also noticed that I was able to get through noticeably less content in the same amount of time. This was because I would pause the video to process what I had just learned and write it down in my own words. While I believe this did help consolidate the concepts I was learning, it certainly took more time.

While taking notes is not completely necessary as I can revisit the original content at any time, I believe it still helped me better understand the material and adds the benefit of being able to go back and relearn the content from my own words, which I think I'll understand better. Because of this and my improved quiz performance, I think the extra time taken to write notes is worth it, and in the coming weeks I'll continue taking notes during my learning activities.
