## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately **3 hours** on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

When creating a child theme, it is good practice to have all content prepared before writing a single line of code. This is because you are likely to miss edge cases during the development process if the client provides the content afterward. This often leads to having to go back and edit the child theme, which can be time-consuming.

Theme unit tests are used to ensure that a theme can display all content correctly. If you do not have content from a client to test with, a theme unit test is the next best option. It is usually a good idea to perform these tests even if you already have the client's content.

A **child theme** is a modification of an existing theme. It inherits all the attributes of its parent theme but allows you to modify them to suit your needs. The benefit of a child theme is that you can make changes without altering the parent theme directly, ensuring that updates to the parent theme do not overwrite your customisations.

In WordPress, **grandchild themes are not possible**. There are only parent themes and child themes. If you want to modify someone else's existing child theme, you will need to edit the files directly, as you cannot create a child theme of a child theme.

Designing in the browser is a good practice because it allows you to see changes immediately. If you are happy with the changes, you can then copy the code to your local environment. It is important to note that changes made in the browser are not saved, so make small changes and save them in your local files to avoid losing progress.

**Pluggable functions** are a feature that allows child themes to **override functions defined in a parent theme**. This is particularly useful for customising the functionality of parent themes without directly modifying their files, which is considered bad practice as these changes would be overwritten with any updates.

Hooks are points in WordPress's code that allow other functions to add additional functionality. They enable custom PHP functions to interact with WordPress. There are two types of hooks:
1. **Action hooks**, which perform custom functionality
2. **Filter hooks**, which modify existing output

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week, I watched the WordPress: Building Child Themes LinkedIn Learning course. This decision was largely influenced by my learning insight from last week, where I mentioned that I would try to choose learning content relevant to the work I am doing and topics that interest me while still relating to the subject. This approach helped me stay more engaged. Knowing that I had a task directly involving the content I was learning kept me motivated to complete the course. The course also included several challenges, which I found engaging and refreshing, as many other courses I have taken do not include this feature.

I found creating the LinkedIn post a little daunting at first, primarily because I knew that future employers would likely see it, and this could affect my chances of landing a job. Because of this, I put a fair amount of effort into it due to its potential audience. I realised the importance of presenting myself professionally and authentically on professional networking platforms like LinkedIn. Everything I post, share, comment on, or like will impact my online presence. Creating the post helped me overcome some initial hesitation with interacting on platforms like LinkedIn, and I will hopefully feel more comfortable creating posts in the future.
