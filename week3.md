## Learning Activities & Resources

[WordPress: Workflows (2015) - LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015/welcome?u=2223545)

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 3 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

WordPress workflows are structured processes for developing WordPress websites in a quick and organized way. The workflow you choose depends on your situation:  
- **"Building Your First WordPress Site"** - Ideal for beginners.  
- **"Customizing Your Site with a Child Theme"** - For modifying an existing theme.  
- **"Building a Custom Site for Yourself or a Client"** - For advanced users creating tailored solutions.  

When setting up a WordPress site, you have two main hosting choices:  
- **Shared Hosting**: Inexpensive but requires manual WordPress setup and management.  
- **Managed Hosting**: More expensive but includes pre-installed WordPress and managed services. Generally, it has better performance than shared hosting as well.  
It is important to pick the correct type of hosting based on your requirements.  

A child theme is a custom theme that inherits the styling and functionality of its parent theme, allowing you to modify specific files or features without affecting the parent theme. Key points:  
- Use a child theme any time you want to change the appearance or behavior of an existing theme.  
- Ensure the parent theme is installed; otherwise, the child theme won't work.  
- Test your child theme using theme unit test data to ensure it handles various content types correctly.  

It is generally a good idea to write all content directly in WordPress to avoid losing formatting or styling when importing from external applications.  

When uploading media files in WordPress, you should upload smaller files (e.g., images, documents) directly to WordPress. As for larger files (e.g., videos, audio), external media-sharing platforms like YouTube should be used to prevent site slowdowns during high traffic.  

A staging environment is a private duplicate of your live site, used for testing and development. It limits access to stakeholders during development and allows you to test changes before going live. This helps reduce risks when deploying changes, and most hosting providers offer tools to swap staging and production servers seamlessly.  

Avoid building content in a local development environment. Instead, create content on the live site and migrate it down if needed. This simplifies the process and avoids complications.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I can see the use of the different WordPress workflows I learned about this week in the LinkedIn Learning course. Although the workflow for building custom sites for clients seems a bit advanced for me now, I can see its efficiency and potential use in professional settings.

While working on the practical, I found WordPress more intuitive and easier to use than Joomla, largely due to the Gutenberg block editor, which I think is well-designed and user-friendly.

During the interview activity, I noticed that some of my questions were evoking overly positive and possibly disingenuous responses. One such question was, "How motivated are you to work on this project?" Since most people are unlikely to admit a lack of motivation, I rephrased it to, "Can you share an example of when you lost motivation in a project and how you regained it?" This adjustment helped me gather more genuine and insightful answers.

I also realized that I value teammates who can provide specific examples of how they've demonstrated skills in teamwork scenarios. In the future, I'll apply this insight to job interviews by ensuring I provide examples of scenarios in which I have used my skills.
