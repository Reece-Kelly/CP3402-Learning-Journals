## Content Insights

Wordpress Workflows are a structured way of developing WordPress websites in the quickest and most efficiently organized way.

There are multiple different workflows depending, each dependent on what your current situation is for wordpress:
1 - "Building Your First WordPress site"
2 - "Customizing Your Site with a Child Theme"
3 - "Building a Custom Site for Yourself or a Client"

When setting up your WordPress site there are two main types of hosting that you can choose from:
1 - Shared Hosting, which is inexpensive, but you have to set up WordPress and manage it yourself.
2 - Managed Hosting, which can be more expensive, but WordPress is pre-installed and the host manages it.

It is generally a good idea to write all content within WordPress itself, as if it is imported from another application this can lead to the loss of specific formatting and styling.

Generally, when uploading media files to your site, smaller media files such as images, graphics, documents, and other small items should be in put in WordPress, whereas as larger media files like video and audio should be uploaded on a dedicated service like Youtube for example. This will ensure that your site stays online even with heavy traffic, as all the larger files are provided by another provider.

A child theme is custom theme which inherits the attributes of it's parent theme, and you only change the files/ parts of the child theme that you want to change. You use a child theme any time you want to change the appearance or behaviour of an existing theme.

It is not advisable to build content for your site in your local development environment. If you want to build new content, do it on the live site and migrate it down. This is because it is far more complicated to build 

When developing a site using wordpress there are many components that need to be managed, these being:
- Domain and hosting
- Wordpress itself
- Context (text, images, video, etc.)
- Design and development
- Themes and plugins

You can test your child themes functionality by using theme unit test data. This will upload a lot of content to your site to extensively test how your custom child theme handles different types of content. If it passes all these test it is ready to publish to the web.

When using a child-theme, you must ensure the parent theme is installed as well otherwise it will not work.

A staging evironment is useful for first implementations as it is a private duplicate of the live environment while limiting access to only stakeholders. After the site is ready to go live on the staging server, you can swap the content of the production server (live server) and the staging server usually with an option on the hosting provider you are using.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
While working on this weeks practical I found it easier and more intuitive to work with WordPress rather than Joomla. I think this is largely due to the Gutenberg block editor, which I believe is really well designed and easy to use.

During the interview activity during this weeks practical I found some of my questions were getting answers which I believed were not completely honest as the question pointed them in the direction of a positive answer. One example of these questions was "How motivated are you to work on this project?". This question led to everyone answering to with answers similar to "I'm very motivated", obviously someone is not going to say they are unmotivated. So I adjusted the question to "Give me an example of where you lost motivation in a group project, and how you regained it" so I could gain more genuine answers.
