## Content Insights

Web Design is a discipline which concerns itself with the apppearance and forward facing functonality of the site, and web development, deals with what is behind the scenes both in code and on the hardware.

All though Web Design is sometimes thought to be largely separate from web engineering, typically Web Design is used as an unmbrella term that encompasses all the disciplines that come together to create a website.

In essence, a website is a means of presenting information. What sets websites apart from other means of presenting information is they allow the creator to change how the user can access that information. "The goal or purpose of web design is to create informational user experiences."

The wants of the site owner and the end user differ quite significantly. The site owner platform choice and CMS choice and the ease of interaction and publication. On the other hand, the site user is concerned about the findability, the informational value, the accuracy of the information, and the sharibility.

As a web designer, it's important to realise that the end user prioritizes accessing content over the technical preferences or bisases of web designers. Web designers should follow this mantra. "My feelings on the end user's choices are irrelevant; my goal is to provide the best possible experience, regardless of how they access the content."

The two ideals that should guide you when designing a website are:
1. Adopt progressive enhancement
2. Design around content

In the web design process, the client should be considered apart of the team so that they can provide vision, content and input along the way.

A website is not a static entity, it evolves over time with no final version.

To maintain consistency in a website, guides that discuss content, style, code, and process should be created and maintained.

Based on the Mapping the Modern Web Design Process there are multiple stages:
1. Preprocess
2. Content Strategy Phase
3. Pre-build Testing
4. Build Phase

content priority heirarchies are charts that are created during the content strategy phase. By organizing content into site-wide and individual-view hierarchies, you ensure that the most critical information is immediately accessible to users, while information that is less important is still accessbile.

You, your team, and the client are unfit to represent the end user as you all carry bias which will make your input not genuine. It's important to note that the end user does not share your understanding as web designer.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Similar to my insight from my first week of learning, I found myself getting easily distracted while watching the LinkedIn Learning course. I had trouble staying engaged and was frankly quite bored, and this may have been due to the fact the content was more designed for use by professional web developers already working on projects or just starting them. Because some parts were not entire;y relevant to me I believe this lowered my engagement. To fix this I... [WHAT DID YOU DO!!!!]
