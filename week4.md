## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 4 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

Web design focuses on the appearance and user-facing functionality of a site, while web development deals with the underlying code and hardware. Although often seen as separate, web design is frequently used as an umbrella term encompassing all disciplines involved in creating a website.

A website is a platform for presenting information. Its unique advantage lies in allowing creators to control how users access that information. The primary goal of web design is to create effective informational user experiences.

The needs of site owners and end users differ significantly. Owners prioritize platform choice, CMS selection, and ease of content publication, while users focus on findability, informational value, accuracy, and shareability of content.

As a web designer, it's crucial to prioritize the end user's experience over personal technical preferences. The guiding mantra should be: "My feelings on the end user's choices are irrelevant; my goal is to provide the best possible experience, regardless of how they access the content."

Two key ideals should guide website design:
1. Adopt progressive enhancement.
2. Design around content.

Clients should be considered part of the design team, providing vision, content, and input throughout the process. This ensures alignment between their goals and the final product. The opposite of this would be only contacting them at the start of the process, which regularly leads to disappointment in the final product.

A website is not static; it evolves over time with no definitive "final version." Continuous updates and improvements are essential to keep it relevant.

To maintain consistency, create and maintain guides for content, style, code, and processes. These serve as references for ongoing development and updates.

The modern web design process includes the following stages:
1. Preprocess
2. Content Strategy Phase
3. Pre-build Testing
4. Build Phase
5. Post-build Testing
6. Optimization Phase
7. Launch and Reset

Designers, teams, and clients cannot accurately represent end users due to inherent biases. It's essential to recognize that end users do not share the same technical understanding as designers, so their understanding must be recorded and followed in the design process.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Similar to my insight from the first week of learning, I found myself easily distracted while watching the LinkedIn Learning course. I had trouble staying engaged and was frankly quite bored. This may have been because the content was more tailored to professional web developers who are already working on projects or just starting them. Since some parts were not entirely relevant to me at this stage, I believe this lowered my engagement. Because of this realization, I will ensure that I watch content with more practical tasks and focus on topics that interest me but are still relevant to the subject.

I am particularly interested in JavaScript, as I have little experience with it and recognize its importance in web development. I found the Codecademy introductory course on JavaScript to be more engaging and enjoyable due to its focus on practical tasks. In the coming weeks, I will explore whether I can find learning resources that replicate this style but focus on other areas of web development and CMSs.

After learning more about the web design process, I can say I am not very interested in becoming a UX designer. However, I did enjoy the JavaScript exercises I completed this week, so I am more interested in pursuing a career that involves using JavaScript heavily, such as backend development with Node.js.
