## Estimated Hours

## Content Insights

There are only 2 files that are required when creating a WordPress theme, these being style.css for styling and index.php as the default template to fall back to if no others are found.

(REWORD THIS)
The Wordpress template heirarchy is a system that WordPress uses to determine which template files to load and display content based on different types of pages or content. It can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)

Specific meta data is required in a comment at the top of a style.css file in a theme, such as the theme name
