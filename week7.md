## Content Insights

There are only 2 files that are required when creating a WordPress theme, these being style.css for styling and index.php as the default template to fall back to if no others are found.

The Wordpress template heirarchy is a system that WordPress uses to determine which template files to load and display content based on different types of pages or content. It can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

Specific meta data is required in a comment at the top of a style.css file in a theme, such as the theme name.

PHP (hypertext preprocessor, originally meaning personal homepage) is a HTML embedded scripting language that is used to create dynamic websites. In a PHP file, you can combine PHP and HTML. The file cannot be a HTML file, as the server will not execute PHP code in a HTML file. When PHP is run on the server, it is sent to the PHP interpreter which processes the code and generates HTML which is then sent to the client's browser. PHP code is enclosed in <?php ?> tags and variables start with a $ sign.

Styles and scripts are enqueued using the wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script functions in the functions.php file.

The header.php and footer.php files are created to separate the header and footer content from the main template. On top of this, the wp_head() and wp_footer() functions are used to dynamically load styles and scripts on the header and footer

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week, I noticed a decline in my motivation to complete certain tasks, which I believe was due to not starting my work for the practical or the journal at my usual time. Generally, I start either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. However, because there was no practical this week due to the floods I ended up not starting my work until later. This shift in routine in combination with having more work than usual contributed to my lack of motivation. Based on this insight, I will now aim to start my work at the same time every week to avoid any lack of motivation.
