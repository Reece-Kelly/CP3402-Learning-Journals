## Content Insights

The term "WordPress" refers to the free, open-source web publishing application used to create websites. WordPress.org is the official website for the WordPress project, where you can download WordPress, access documentation, and participate in support forums. On the other hand, WordPress.com is a SaaS platform offering hosted WordPress sites with free and paid plans, though it restricts certain features. A common misconception is not understanding the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com.

The three main content types in WordPress are posts, pages, and media elements. Posts are organized by categories and tags and are typically used for time-sensitive content. Pages, however, are for static, timeless content that doesn’t change frequently and are not organized by tags. Instead, they are hierarchical (e.g., an "About Us" page). Media elements include things such as images and videos, they are usually included in posts and pages but can be standalone items

Categories are the primary taxonmy used to group related posts toegether. They are hierarchical, meaning they can have parent-child relationships. On the other hand, tags are optional and used to connect posts through keywords.

WordPress 5.5 includes many upgrades from version 5.4, such as limited inline image editing, and a block directory section that allows users to search for and install new blocks directly from the editor. It also introduces automatic updates for plugins and themes.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

WordPress is the world’s most popular CMS, powering more than 30% of the top 10 million websites. I believe this would make experience with WordPress attractive to potential employers in web design and development due to its widespread use and the fact it's been the most popular CMS for many years now.

When working with Joomla to develop the website for this week’s practical task, I found the process both challenging and not very rewarding. I am very aware that learning to use any new technology requires time and effort, but the experience did not feel particularly fulfilling. As a result, I do not see myself pursuing a career in Joomla development.

The LinkedIn Learning course on WordPress that I completed this week included frequent and helpful quizzes throughout the modules. I found these quizzes beneficial as they helped me retain the information from the videos rather than forgetting it immediately. Additionally, I installed WordPress on my laptop to follow along with the instructor’s demonstrations. This approach was based on my learning insight from last week, where I theorized that I would learn better through practical tasks rather than passive watching. I felt more engaged and believe I retained information more effectively as a result of the hands-on activities. However, I still found myself getting distracted at times while working, so I may need to explore additional methods to improve my focus.
