## Learning Activities & Resources

[Sass Essential Training - LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training-15630917/how-can-sass-help-build-sites?u=2223545)

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 1.5 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a superset of CSS, meaning all valid CSS is also valid SCSS, but not vice versa.

Sass does not make a website look better, but is a metalanguage that simplifies stylesheet creation for developers compared to plain CSS.

All Sass features are documented in the [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)

Since browsers cannot interpret Sass directly, it must first be compiled into CSS using a Sass preprocesser before it can be used in a webpage. 

Some of the most prominent features of Sass include variables, mixins, inheritance (@extend), and nesting.

There are two different Sass Syntax formats:

1. `.sass` format - Uses indentation instead of braces and semicolons and is more concise, but less like CSS.

2. `.scss` format (AKA Sassy CSS) - Fully compatible with CSS (all valid CSS is valid SCSS). It is also the most popular of the two formats due to it's familiarality

Sass variables begin with a dollar sign and are declared in the format:

`$variable: expression`

You can create variables at a global scope, or within curly braces for local scope. If a variable is defined in both a global scope and local scope, the local scope variable takes precedence. Hyphens and underscores are treated the same in Sass, this is something to be careful of when naming variables.


Developer's can use a filewatcher such as [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulphttps://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) when editing their Sass files to automatically recompile them into CSS. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After researching, I found that multiple sources stated that Sass is still widely used by web developers today. However, I also discovered that due to the rapid development of CSS over the years, Sass has become less essential than it once was. Features that were once unique to Sass, such as variables and nesting, are now integrated into native CSS. Considering this, if I do more web development in the future, I will evaluate the complexity of the project before deciding whether to use Sass.

In terms of employability, after reviewing job listings for web developers on LinkedIn and Seek, I did not find any that explicitly required or even preferred Sass experience. Given this, it may be more beneficial to focus on other web development skills rather than Sass, as it appears to be a more niche requirement.

This week, I had limited time due to upcoming deadlines for multiple assessments. As a result, I couldn’t spend as much time searching through learning activities or choosing one that interested me. Instead, I used the recommended activity for the week. Although it was helpful to learn more about Sass, I wasn’t able to apply my previous learning strategies effectively (e.g., taking notes, doing quizzes, or selectively watching relevant content). This reduced my engagement compared to when I had used those techniques. From this experience, I’ve learned that allocating sufficient time for quality learning is important, but sometimes it simply isn’t feasible or a high enough priority.

An obvious, but easier said than done, solution is to improve my time management. I will research some techniques and try to implement them in this final week of the subject.
