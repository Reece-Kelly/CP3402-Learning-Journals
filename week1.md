# Week 1: Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I used W3 Schools "How To - Make a Website" tutorial to assist me in completing Practical 1. Since it has been nearly two years since I last used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I found this resource helpful in refreshing my knowledge. I frequently referred to W3Schools while implementing specific website features.

To further reinforce my understanding, I watched the Introduction to Web Design and Development course on LinkedIn Learning. This course provided a few practical examples that helped me relearn the fundamentals of these three languages while also introducing me to different content managment systems and their purposes. It also covered some topics in web design I had forgotten about or had little knowledge on.

As I was unfamiliar with CMSs, I watched a short introductory video I found on youtube to gain a general understanding of their role in web development.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 4 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

While working through the LinkedIn Learning course, W3Schools tutorial, and the practical, I refreshed my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, through these activities I realised that my knowledge and skills in these languages is quite lacking, showing me that further practice and learning is required.

Additionally, I gained a clearer understanding of what CMSs are and how they simplify web development and design by reducing the amount of coding that is required. Learning about popular CMS platforms like WordPress and Joomla gave me insight into how these tools make building and managing websites easier. This new knowledge helped me understand why CMSs are so useful and popular, especially since my previous experience in CP1406 involved building websites from scratch.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I enjoyed creating a website for this week's practical, even though it was very basic. Web development is certainly an area I am interested in in terms of a career, though I am a bit more interested in the backend programming rather than the frontend design. 
I can see how experience with web development programming languages would be valuable to a future employer, especially JavaScript due to its diverse range of applications.

While I was able to watch the LinkedIn Learning course with minimal distraction, I believe I would have been better focused and retained more information had there been more practical tasks to complete. The course really only had one or two tasks, and while this did help refresh my knowledge of web design and development I felt I could have learnt more with practice amongst watching the videos. In future, I will look for learning activities and resources that are more hands-on in their approach rather than just videos, or I may create my own tasks once I have learnt a new topic to reinforce my learning.
