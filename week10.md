## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 1.5 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

You can automatically back up your WordPress site by using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus. This is crucial in case you ever lose your website's content and need to restore it to a previous version. Within UpdraftPlus, you can configure settings to determine backup frequency and whether to store backups on external storage (e.g., OneDrive).

The restoration process for a website is as follows:

1. Get the most current version of your backup files and database
2. Set up a temporary maintenance page
3. Upload the new files
4. Restore the database
5. Test thoroughly
6. Remove temporary maintenance page

You can use phpMyAdmin to restore a previous database version if your current one is compromised.

It’s important to keep WordPress updated, as older versions may contain vulnerabilities that expose your site to attacks.

The three key components to maintain are:

1. WordPress core files
2. Plugins
3. Themes

WordPress automatically notifies you when updates are available for any of these.

Additionally, you should change the default admin username to something difficult to guess, as many automated attacks assume it is "admin."

WordPress has five default user roles, each with different permissions:

1. Administrator
2. Editor
3. Author
4. Contributor
5. Subscriber

You can modify these roles using plugins and themes to better suit your site’s needs.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week I experimented with using the Pomodoro technique to help improve my study efficiency. I implemented this in response to last week’s realization that my time management needed improvement. I figured I could make better use of the time I dedicated to CMS study using this technique, as it is very popular study method. I found using this technique was quite helpful, and despite the increased amount of breaks, I covered more content than usual and maintained better focus compared to when not using it. Setting a clear goal for each 25-minute session helped me stay on track. I enjoyed the pomodoro technique, and I can see myself using it again in my future studies.

After completing the group project this week, I reflected and found that WordPress theme development and web development in general were not areas I wished to find a career in. However, I’ve gained valuable transferable skills, including familiarity with modern workflows and tools like Trello, Docker, and WordPress. Given their popularity in the IT industry, I believe these skills will be attractive to employers.
