## Learning Activities & Resources

[WordPress: Developing Secure Sites](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-developing-secure-sites/welcome?u=2223545)

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 1.5 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

You can automatically backup your WordPress site by using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus. This is important in case you ever lose the contents of your website and need to restore it to a previous version. You can configure settings within UpdraftPlus to determine how often backups should be made and if you want to have them sent to external storage (e.g. Onedrive)

The process for restoration of a website is:

1. Get the most current version of your backup files and database
2. Set up a temporary maintenance page
3. Upload the new files
4. Restore the database
5. Test thoroughly
6. Remove temporary maintenance page

You can use phpMyAdmin to restore a previous version of your database if your current one is compromised.

It is important to be using the most up to date version of WordPress, as using older versions can make your website vulnerable to attacks through vulnerabilities in the older version.

The 3 main things to keep up to date are:

1. WordPress core files
2. Plugins
3. Themes

WordPress will automatically create a notification if there are updates for any of these 3 things.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week I experimented with using the Pomodoro technique when studying. I used this in response to my insight last week that my time management was not as good as it could have been. I found using this technique was quite helpful, and despite the increased amount of breaks, I was able to get through more content than usual and that I was more focused. What helped was writing down a clear goal for each pomodoro work session, so I knew exactly what I needed to achieve in the next 25 minutes. I enjoyed using this technique, and I can see myself using it again in my studies.

After completing the group project this week, I reflected and found that WordPress theme development and web development in general were not areas I wished to find a career in. That being said, I believe I have learnt quite a few skills in this subject which are transferable to many different careers in IT.
