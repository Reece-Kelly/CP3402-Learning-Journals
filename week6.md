## Content Insights

A **stand-up meeting** is a type of meeting typically used in Agile work environments. It involves team members standing in a circle and updating each other on their tasks. This meeting is generally conducted at the beginning of the workday and should last no more than 15 minutes.

During the meeting, team members must answer three key questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What am I doing today?
3. Are there any obstacles in my way?

Stand-up meetings help keep everyone on track, identify roadblocks, and do not take up much valuable working time. They are a self-organizing activity and should not become a status meeting led by the Project Manager or Scrum Master. This is because that approach reflects traditional project management rather than an Agile one.

**Kanban** is an Agile method used to manage a continuous queue of work items. It is a lightweight and efficient method, as making changes to a Kanban board is very simple and quick. The goal is to move work items continuously to the "done" column.

A team can adjust the types and number of columns on a Kanban board based on their situation, but typically there will be at least the following three columns:

- Inbox column: Contains tasks that need to be completed but have not been started.

- In-progress column: Contains tasks that have been started, along with their current status.

- Done column: Contains tasks that have been completed and is used to track the history of tasks.

Other common columns that may be added to a kanban board include:

- Backlog column: Contains tasks that are not ready to be worked on, but will be moved to the inbox column once they are.

- Review column: Common in software development, tasks placed in this column are reviewed before being placed in the done column.

The minimum and/or maximum number of issues allowed in certain project board columns is specified in Kanban to limit work-in-progress (WIP). This helps improve workflow because, when there are roadblocks, the team can work together to solve them before moving on to other tasks, and it limits multitasking. WIP limits can be adjusted or removed entirely based on what works best for the team.

In Git, the .gitignore file allows you to specify which files and directories should not be tracked within the repository. This feature is commonly used to ignore sensitive files containing secrets or files that do not need to be tracked, such as local notes.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week, I tried focusing only on content directly relevant to the work I will be undertaking in the group project. Rather than completing entire LinkedIn courses, I selectively watched sections that I believed were most applicable to the tasks I would have in the next few weeks. This approach improved my engagement, as I knew I could apply the majority of what I was learning. 

On the other hand, there have been times this trimester where I have watched educational content that was not entirely relevant to this subject or aligned with my career goals. I found it difficult to focus on this type of content because I could not picture myself using the teachings in the future.

I've determined that I want to pursue a career in software development, as I find the problem-solving and programming challenges within this IT degree the most rewarding. While I'm aware that this subject does not include as many programming tasks as the first three programming subjects, it has helped me realize that I enjoy front-end development and web-design less than I enjoy solving traditional programming problems.

While I had some prior awareness, I have know come to understand how Git is used across the large majority development roles. While working on some tasks this week, I noticed gaps in my knowledge of using Git. As a result, I plan to spend more time studying Git-related content in the coming weeks, as I think itâ€™s especially important for me to know it, considering I am aiming to start a career in software development.
