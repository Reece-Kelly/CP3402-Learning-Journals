## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 2.5 hours on explicit learning activities this week.

## Content Insights

A **stand-up meeting** is a type of meeting typically used in Agile work. It involves team members standing in a circle and updating each other on their tasks. This meeting is generally conducted at the beginning of the workday and should last no more than 15 minutes.

During the meeting, team members must answer three key questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What am I doing today?
3. Are there any obstacles in my way?

Stand-up meetings help keep everyone on track, identify roadblocks, and don't take up much valuable working time. They are a self-organizing activity and should not become a status meeting led by the Project Manager or Scrum Master. This is because that approach reflects traditional project management rather than an Agile one.

**Kanban** is an agile method used to manage a continuous queue of work items. It is a lightweight and efficient method, as making changes to a kanban board is very simple and quick. The goal is to move work items continuously to the "done" column.

A team can adjust the types and number of columns in a kanban board based on their situation, but typically there will be atleast the 3 following columns:

- Inbox column -> Contains tasks that need to be completed but haven't been started

- In-progress column -> Contains tasks that have been started and their current status.

- Done colummn -> Contains tasks that have been completed, and is used to see the history of tasks.

Other common columns that may be added to a kanban board include:

- Backlog column -> Contains tasks that are not ready to be worked on, but will be moved to the inbox column once they are.

- Review column -> Common in software development, tasks placed in this column are reviewed before being placed in the done column.

The minimum and/or maximum number of issues allowed in certain project board columns is specified in kanban to limit work-in-progress (WIP). This helps improve work-flow, because when there are road-blocks the team can work together to solve them before moving onto other tasks, and limits multitasking. WIP limits can be adjusted or removed entirely based on what works best for the team.

In git, the .gitignore file allows you to specify which files and directores should not be tracked within the repository. This feature is commonly used to ignore sensitive files containing secrets or files that aren't needed to be tracked such as a local notes.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week, I tried only focusing on content that is relevant to the work I will be doing in the group project. Instead of watching entire LinkedIn courses I opted to just watch sections of them which I believed were relevant. I found this really helped keep me engaged, as I knew I could apply the majority of what I was learning, as opposed to other times where I was watching content that would not be relevant to any of the tasks I would have to do in the future.

I've realised that git is used in almost every software development job and it is important to understand it. I realised while completing some of the tasks this week that my knowledge is a bit lacking, so I will continue to focus on git related content in the coming weeks.
